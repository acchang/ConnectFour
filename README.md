# ConnectFour
ConnectFour attempt

12/14 - I'm still having problems with imposing minimax here. I might not be able to do it since checking for a winner involves manipulating the DOM, and that would be a huge amount of possibilites for Connect Four. 

It might be better if I went back to Tic Tac Toe, learned that, and learned how to build Connect Fout via primitives, and then used minimax with the primitives.

12/7 - built the gameboard and logic from this tutorial:

Now I'm going to look at my old Tic Tac Toe and see if I can use minimax to get it to play

I wil iterate through the columns until row is less than 0
if there is a win, look at the player token, add points


I might need to build a randomized AI opponent first.

Or just find the optimal next choice.
